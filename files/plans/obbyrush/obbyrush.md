# Contributing

You can make Roblox maps and levels for the game with Roblox Studio (requires prior Studio knowledge, recommends courses on Roblox website) 
- First create a new game with a place to build your map on.
- You should follow the map guides for each gamemode here (not yet).
- Please keep the map lightweight, recommends Roblox parts only because this is an obby game, pack it in a model.
- When you have done, go to File --> Save to Files and send me the file through [contacts](#contacts), the map will be added to the game and you will get credited on the game description and map selection page.

You can view the current maps in game or development [here](#maps).

You can also contribute and change content in this plan by opening a pull request at [the Github repo](https://github.com/FuniJaerri/FuniJaerri/) (you should read about markdown at https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
